# Breakout

**This repository was make for me to practice my git usage and do some coding that I think might one day help with robotics.**

I am starting this in Julia to figure out *what* I need to learn, and then will redo all of it in C. 


## VS Code Setup


## Git starter
We do the following once we have our folder locall.y
- git init 
- git add . 
- git commit -m "first commit" 
- git branch -M main 
- git remote add origin [file name]
- git push -u origin main
